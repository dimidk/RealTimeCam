This is a project about real time object detection running on
Raspberry Pi 5 using Pi Camera Module v3

For object detection YOLOv8 algorithm is used.
This version of YOLO is suitable for low latency devices
and a pre-trained model of YOLO yolov8n.pt

More details about project is going to be given
as the implementation is taking place.
